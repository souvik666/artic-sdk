# ArticSdk Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the ArticSdk documentation! This document provides an in-depth overview of the `ArticSdk` class. Developed by **Souvik666**, this SDK serves as a gateway to the Artic Framework's diverse services and functionalities. With static properties, it offers seamless access to service instances designed to manage agents, artworks, exhibitions, products, places, and galleries.

## üöÄ Getting Started 

Getting started with the `ArticSdk` is easy! Begin by importing the class and utilizing its service instances in your application. This example showcases how to get started:

```typescript
import { ArticSdk } from 'path-to-your-sdk';

// Access service instances
const agentInstance = ArticSdk.agent;
const artworkInstance = ArticSdk.artwork;
const exhibitionInstance = ArticSdk.exhibition;
// ... and so on
```
# Service Instances 

## AgentService
The AgentService instance allows you to seamlessly manage agents within the Artic Framework. This service facilitates the retrieval of agent information, searching for agents, and more. Here's how you can interact with it:
```typescript
// Retrieve a list of agents with pagination and search
const agents = await agentInstance.get({
  params: {
    limit: 10,
    page: 1,
    fields: 'artist_pivots',
    ids: '1,2,3,4'
  },
  config: {} // Extra header configuration if needed
});

// Get details of a specific agent
const specificAgent = await agentInstance.getOne(agentId);

// Search for agents based on various criteria
const searchedAgents = await agentInstance.search({
  params: {
    limit: 10,
    page: 1,
    fields: 'artist_pivots',
    q: 'Hello world',
    // ... other search parameters
  },
  config: {} // Extra header configuration if needed
});


```

- ‚òòÔ∏è Repeat this pattern for other service instances, such as `Artwork`, `ExhibitionsService`, `ProductService`, `PlaceService`, and so on.
